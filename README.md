This repo is created for 4 semester study projects at MIPT â˜€

## [Research about operations with int type](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Sorting_research)

This project is a small study about the int type using sorts as an example. In [one](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Sorting_research/Sort_efficiency) of the cases, graphs are plotted of the number of comparisons and assignments versus the number of array elements in different sorts. The [second](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Sorting_research/Sort_visualize) subproject is sorting visualization (real-time rendering)

## [Microscope](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Dumping_int)

This project is a so-called microscope through which we will see everything that happens with the int type: unnecessary and unexpected copies when passed to functions, and much more.

## [Data copy study](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Move%26forward_research)

This project is a research and search for copying and moving in different situations. Read the full study at the link in the title.

## [Vector](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Templates/Container)

This is my vector implementation. It supports all the basic methods that std::vector can also implement. This was written to understand what's going on under the hood when we use the standard container methods.

## [String](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Templates/String)

This is my string implementation. It supports COW and SSO optimizations and also contains string-view.
