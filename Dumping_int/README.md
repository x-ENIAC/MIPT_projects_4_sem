This repo is created for 4 semester study projects at MIPT. Below you can see the names of the projects and their small descriptions.

## [Research about operations with int type](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Sorting_research)

This project is a small study about the int type using sorts as an example. In one of the cases, graphs are plotted of the number of comparisons and assignments versus the number of array elements in different sorts. The second subproject is sorting visualization (real-time rendering)

## [Data copy study](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Dumping_int)
