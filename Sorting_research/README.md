This repo contains small studies of sorts. 

## [Sort_efficiency](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Sorting_research/Sort_efficiency)

The program plots the number of comparisons and assignments depending on the number of array elements in different sorts. The first time you click on the sort name, its graph appears, when you click it again, it disappears. Each time a sort is added or removed, the scale is recalculated. The colors of the buttons correspond to the colors of the lines on the charts. Let's look at examples:

## [Sort_visualize](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_4_sem/tree/master/Sorting_research/Sort_visualize)

This program sorts an array in real time. Click on "Start" and see! You can pause it with the "Stop" button. "Refresh" fills the array with new values. You can also choose sorting: while bubble and insert sorts are available.
